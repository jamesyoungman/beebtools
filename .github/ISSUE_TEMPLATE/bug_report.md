**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.   

- Does the code build on your system?
- Is the problem with just one program (e.g. "dfs" or "bbcbasic_to_text")?

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. What exact command-line did you use?
2. What input did you use?  (For dfs, this is a disc image and for bbcbasic_to_text this is a BBC BASIC program file)

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
Please capture the expected output as text.

For dfs bugs, explain how to use your disc image in an emulator (one of: beebjit, MAME or b-em).   Include any configuration settings (e.g. keyboard DIP switch settings).  Include an exact capture of the output you expect (you can capture this with VDU 2 and the emulators "capture printer output" feature).

For bbcbasic_to_text bugs, include the input BBC BASIC program, and the LISTO 0 listing you expect.   You can capture this with VDU 2, as mentioned above.

**Screenshots**
Do not include screenshots, include the exact text instead; see above for how.

**Additional context**
